Do men gather grapes from thorn bushes or figs from thistles? Even so, EVERY GOOD TREE BEARS GOOD FRUIT, but A BAD TREE BEARS BAD FRUIT. A GOOD tree CANNOT BEAR BAD fruit, nor can a BAD tree BEAR GOOD fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. THEREFORE BY THEIR FRUITS you WILL KNOW them” (Matthew 7:15-20) [emphasis mine]."},
